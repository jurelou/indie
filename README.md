Indie Studio is the last C++ project of your second year in Epitech. It
consists in programming a 3D video game with real tools.
You will have to choose a game to make. All your game will have to feature specific
functionnalities and to offer a real gaming experience.

Worms is a artillery game created in 1995 by Andy Davidson and Team17, inspired by the
classic video game “Artillery”, by Mike Forman, released in 1976.
